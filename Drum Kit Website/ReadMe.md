This a drum kit website in which I have added different types of drum and their sound effects.
I have used html css and javascript languages to implement the website.

Process of creating the website:

step 1: Created index.html, style.css and index.js and linked both the css and javascript file with the html file.

step 2: Then we added the letters and images to the buttons.

step 3: After this we added event listeners to the button to add/show animation to the button whenever we click it or press the letter added to the button.

step 4: Finally added the sounds to the buttons using javascript objects and methods.
